My name is Bryce Rogan, and I am currently a Quantitative Analyst for the Los Angeles Angels, the professional baseball team. The fun way I typically describe my job is that if you've seen the movie [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)), I do the work of Jonah Hill's character, but modernized with current machine learning, data science, and statistics. Prior to the Angels, I received a B.A. in Mathematics from Pomona College in 2018, where I completed a [couple](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927025619301223) [different](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7952639) [published research projects](/home/publications) using machine learning.

I'll be intermittently posting work here, but in the meantime [here is my resume](./content/about/resume_rogan.pdf), if that's something you might be interested in, and feel free to contact me via email or otherwise!
